Numeric-Conversion!:

This project is another foundational piece in my python journey. 
It helped me comprehend and put these principles into practice:

- Object Oriented Programming
- Defining Functions
- Binary/Hexadecimal Conversion
- Input Functions
- Using Dictionaries
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Manipulating Variables
- Lists/Appending Lists
- Using Built-In Python Functions (.reverse)
- Debugging

Although this project is small in scale, it was effective in building my knowledge in these categories. It allowed me to learn to write more concise and "cleaner" looking code, which is a skill I am sure will continue to grow as I continue programming.
